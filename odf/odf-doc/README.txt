The documentation project is based on the Maven Site Plugin and Maven Doxia. The resulting war file is merged into the war file of the sdp-web project using the overlay mechanism of the Maven War Plugin. The resulting documentation is available through the getting started page of the SDP web console. 

Edit the src/site/markdown/*.md files in order to update the documentation. The structure of the web site can be changed in file src/site/site.xml.
