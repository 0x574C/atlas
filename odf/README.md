Open Discovery Framework
==========================

The Open Discovery Framework (ODF) is an open metadata-based framework that strives to be a common home for different analytics technologies that discover characteristics of data sets and relationships between them (think "AppStore for discovery algorithms"). Using ODF, applications can leverage new discovery algorithms and their results with minimal integration effort.

See [here](odf-doc/src/site/markdown/build.md) how to build and deploy ODF.
